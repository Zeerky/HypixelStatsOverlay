Welcome to a a functioning but not really nice looking stats overlay that I made


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: Goto https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python

Step 2: During the installing MAKE SURE to check off this box https://imgur.com/a/Cf8EB0z

Step 3: Click the green button at the top right of this screen and click "Download ZIP"

Step 4: Extract the zip file to a folder and run the .bat file (this will install the requests module for python)

Step 5: Right click the .py file and open with a text editor like notepad

Step 6: You will see instructions at the top where to put your UUID and API Key and how to get them

Step 7: After making the necessary changes, save and close the file and double click it, this should open the overlay



TROUBLESHOOTING:
The "Hypixel Stats Overlay.py" file is not opening and is showing a white page for an icon
	Reinstall Python, restart your computer and try again

My stats are only displaying 0's
	Make sure you correctly set up your API key and UUID
	
Running the programmed resulted in my house catching fire and and I grew and extra arm
	Go do some research on ZeerkyClicker.com I think it might be able to help



I'm still really new to this sort of thing, I suck at programming and have never posted on github before. I would love to hear feedback and if you know how to make it look a little nicer let me know lmao :3
